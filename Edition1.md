### Stress Busters in These Uncertain Times
###### By: Cricket
    
Many of you are worrying and stressing in these times. Many for different things. Maybe you are worried about your nephew, all alone in his apartment. Or maybe you are worried about an elderly neighbor who is at major risk for the virus. Whatever it is, here are five definite stress busters that will help you stay calm and clear. 
Play some white noise, sit criss-cross, and close your eyes.
Any white noise would work (A particular favorite is rain noise).
Breathe in, and push your open palms up. Breathe out, and pull your hands down into closed fists.
This one also works for energizing the body.
Breathe in, and breathe out through a pretend straw in your mouth.
This one works for relaxation and to help fall asleep.
Sit on your couch with a nice cup of tea.
One good relaxer is cinnamon.
Keep a journal, and write your worries in it.
I find that this one works extremely well. It takes out all of your worries so that you don’t have to keep it all in your mind.

Stay Stress-Free and Safe!


### LEAF IN THE WIND 
###### By Cricket
*** 
Come and listen, one and all
To the girl that never tried.
But the one that shall help her will prosper
And the one that shall fight her must die.

Common sense defies and delays what must and will go on.
A natural phenomenon has been delayed so much that thousands of years after it was created, something was gifted to a girl who should not have had it at all. In fact, using common sense, Alex Mayor was a normal, tantrum-throwing toddler with no sign of any magic possible. She was the last person anyone in Oakville would have thought to have those special abilities. In fact, no one thought about magic one bit.
Redundant, isn’t it? Common sense is a screen for common sense.
There was a strange figure of mist whirling around the city. It moved when no one was looking, then stopped when someone was. Nobody gave it a single thought. 
That is, except for one little girl with her mother, huddled around the fireplace near the window. “Mama, what’s that?” 
Her mother, who was reading “how to deal with reckless children”, hardly seemed to notice. “Mama?” the little girl said again.
“Don’t worry, Alex,” her mom said. “It’s just a cloud.” Then she huddled the girl tight and they slept off, right on the carpet.
This figure, that looked like mist, went around the city, all the way to a grimy, dark alley with one old sign: CENTER PLAZA. Then, the mist evaporated in a blink. Which isn’t very common, even for a magical phenomenon like mist. 
             To be Continued…
